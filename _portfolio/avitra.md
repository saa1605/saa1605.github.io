## Introduction 

The tremendous development in the field of robotics has today paved the way for working on the implementation of tasks without human intervention. The development of industry standards such as Robot Operating Systems (ROS) and extensive access to resources has made it possible for budding engineers like us to contribute to the sector of Intelligent Systems. The automation sector today is being powered by autonomous systems and multi-degree of freedom robots are playing a very important role in different applications of automation. They are providing much more accuracy and safety in carrying out critical tasks as compared to the manual work done by humans. This project describes the design and implementation of a 6 DOF robotic arm capable of performing industrial tasks such as pick and place of objects. The design aims to provide fine manipulation in performing pick and place tasks without any human intervention. By integrating the manipulator with a mobile base, an autonomous robot system capable of navigating unstructured terrains and manipulating objects for various applications like drawing, soldering, pick and place, welding etc. can be built. With the help of a depth camera, perception is implemented to enhance the detection techniques thus helping in distinguishing objects and obstacles in applications like search and rescue operation. These perception techniques when collaborated with mobile manipulation can help reaching places and handling objects which would otherwise prove deleterious to humans. With a highly flexible multi-DOF robotic arm, a flexible end effector capable of holding objects of different shapes is also a requirement for manipulation of objects in an unknown environment. Adding a gripper possessing a high holding force helps in grasping objects of different shapes and performing tasks like drawing, soldering etc. where grasping of the object needs to be precise in order to carry out a task. Thus, this project aims to build and implement a robot system with all these above mentioned capabilities.
